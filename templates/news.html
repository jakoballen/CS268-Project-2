            <p><a href="https://themahjongline.com" target="_blank"><img src="../static/images/news/linemahjong.jfif"  alt="The Mahjong Line's redesigned tiles"/></a>The Mahjong Line, a Dallas company has recently been under fire for "white washing" the game by making a new line of tiles that no longer resemble the original design. The company stated that the origninal design of the game
                doesn't do it justice and was aiming to add a spark to the design with modern drawings to pull in more players. The mahjong community in Asia was reported as being upset considering they removed the chinese asthetic from a chinese game.
